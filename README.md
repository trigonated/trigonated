# Hello there!
I’m Tiago Bento aka @trigonated! I'm an Android application developer from Lisbon, but I also work with other tech from time to time.

## Interesting projects I made:
 - [🎮 Game Collection](https://github.com/trigonated/GameCollection) - A showcase of a very modern Android [stack](https://github.com/trigonated/GameCollection#stack) in the form of a demo application.
 - [⚡ Volt Launcher](https://github.com/trigonated/voltlauncher) - A launcher/content manager for RVGL (fan implmentation of the Re-Volt videogame) made in Flutter.
 - [📚 Al Bhed Translator](https://github.com/trigonated/AlBhedTranslator) - An android app that translates to/from the Al Bhed language.
 
## Cool projects I contribute to:
 - [🐇 Jazz 2 Ressurection](https://github.com/deathkiller/jazz2): a fan implementation of the 1998 hit game Jazz Jackrabbit 2, now ported to modern computers and Android.

## What I'm working on:
 - 🔥 Crackle - A Discord bot that plays ambient soundscapes, aiming on helping Tabletop RPG hosts bring more immersion to their games.
 - 🛸 Traveller for Reddit - An alternative Reddit client for Android made with [Jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).
 - 🟠 Rotata - A puzzle game where you rotate your way to domination!
